HOW TO INSTALL CAPS SCENARIO BUILDER

<<<<<<< HEAD
The specifications for CAPS Scenario Builder only require it to run on MS Windows, and there is a stand alone windows installer for the application available at 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/osscripts/files/ or 
https://github.com/EcoGIS/CAPS-Scenario-Builder/downloads
=======
The specifications for CAPS Scenario Builder only require it to run on MS Windows. 
Because the app is written in Python, you can probably get it to run on nearly
any platform, but the instructions below are for MS Windows.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Because this application is written in Python, you can probably get it to run on nearly
any platform.  The information below might save some time.
=======
Install Requirements:  A working installation of QGIS-1.6.0
					   A copy of CAPS_Scenario_Builder.zip	

1) Download the contents of CAPS-Scenario-Builder.zip 
(from https://sourceforge.net/projects/osscripts/files/). 
 Note that this is the same code as found in the master branch at
 https://github.com/EcoGIS/CAPS-Scenario-Builder but includes
some rather large data files that are necessary to run the application. 

2) Unzip the files to C:\Caps_Scenario_Builder.  You may choose another insallation 
location, but you will need to alter the line 
"start "CAPS" /B pythonw "c:\caps\caps.pyw" 
in the file CAPS_copiapo.bat to point to your location.
   
3) If you don't have an existing installation of QGIS Copiapo,
   install using QGIS-1.6.0-Setup.exe (found at http://qgis.org/downloads/).
   
3) Make sure that the "SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\PROGRA~1\QUANTU~1" line in the file 
   CAPS_copiapo.bat points to the installation folder (i.e. Quantum GIS Copiapo)
   
4) Click on CAPS_copiapo.bat to run CAPS Scenario Builder
>>>>>>> refs/heads/master

1) Download the contents of CAPS_Scenario_Builder-0.8.tar.gz
   Everything needed to run the application other than QGIS 1.71 is in that archive.
   
2) If you don't have an existing installation of QGIS Wroclaw,
   install using QGIS-1.7.1, which can be found at http://qgis.org/downloads/
   
3) The file CAPS_wroclaw.bat is a Windows batch file that gives pointers to the paths   of files needed to run CAPS Scenario Builder. You will have to set up the environment properly for your system.

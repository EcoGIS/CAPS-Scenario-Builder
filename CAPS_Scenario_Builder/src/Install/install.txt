INSTALL CAPS SCENARIO BUILDER

The specifications for CAPS Scenario Builder only require it to run on MS Windows.
Because the app is written in Python, you can probably get it to run on nearly
any platform, but the instructions below are for MS Windows.

1) Download the contents of CAPS-Scenario-Builder/src and place in C:\Caps.
   (Note: You don't need to download src/ReferenceCode, src/images, src/old or 
   src/Install/QGIS-1.6.0-Setup.exe). You may choose another location, but you 
   will need to alter the line "start "CAPS" /B pythonw "c:\caps\caps.pyw" in the file 
   CAPS_copiapo.bat to point to your location.
   
2) If you don't have an existing installation of QGIS Copiapo,
   install using QGIS-1.6.0-Setup.exe (found in src/Install).
   
3) Make sure that the "SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\PROGRA~1\QUANTU~1" line in the file 
   CAPS_copiapo.bat points to the installation folder (i.e. Quantum GIS Copiapo)
   
4) Click on CAPS_copiapo.bat to run CAPS Scenario Builder

I don't have the time right now to help with installation issues, so please don't
contact me about installation.  I will make a windows installer sometime in November
or early December, 2011 that should make the installation easy.

Thanks for your interest!

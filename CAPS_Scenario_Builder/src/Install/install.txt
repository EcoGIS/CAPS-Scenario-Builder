INSTALL CAPS SCENARIO BUILDER

The specifications for CAPS Scenario Builder only require it to run on MS Windows, and there is a standalone windows installer for the application available at 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/osscripts/files/ or 
https://github.com/EcoGIS/CAPS-Scenario-Builder/downloads

Because this application is written in Python, you can probably get it to run on nearly
any platform.  The information below might save some time.

1) Download the contents of CAPS_Scenario_Builder-0.8.tar.gz
   Everything needed to run the application other than QGIS 1.71 is in that archive.
   
2) If you don't have an existing installation of QGIS Wroclaw,
   install using QGIS-1.7.1, which can be found at http://qgis.org/downloads/
   
3) The file CAPS_wroclaw.bat is a Windows batch file that indicates the paths of files needed to run CAPS Scenario Builder. You will have to set up the environment properly for your system.	
   
Thanks for your interest!
